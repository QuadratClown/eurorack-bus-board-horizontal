# Eurorack Bus Board with horizontal headers

Minimalist eurorack bus-board with horizontal headers, made with focus on shallow skiffs, where each mm additional space matters.

## Features

8x 16-Pin headers in horizontal configuration. Allows pluging in cables from the side, which makes the footprint very thin (1.5cm) and the bus boards can be placed under the rails themselves.

Each rail (12V, -12V and 5V) is rated for 2A each, which should be easily enough for almost any usecase.

# To-do 

The via sizes are not optimal (hole too big, ring too small), hence the board would need revisiting.

It's still functional though :D
